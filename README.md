# OSCP-PWK-Prep-Resources-
UPDATE 06/01/2020: Hey there friends, I have been very quiet on here, I was surprised to see more people have starred this "guide" more than I expected, so I am glad this provides some use to folks. I do plan on being more active now on here now as I start my OSCP jouney once again. Unfortunately I underestimated the depth of the course and so pretty much found myself struggling in the labs =(. During my time away I have been doing some background studying but not as focused as I want to be before signing up for the lab again. My goal was to actually start again this summer but 2 things occured, Offsec updated the labs and now if I want the updated material AND additional lab time I am looking at spending $999 so I have some $$$ to save. The 2nd delay is because of covid-19, I am blessed to still be working currently but we have idea if things will take a turn so for now I am holding on tight to my purse strings lol. Once I have a better cushion for myself I will feel comfortable dropping $999. During my time away I did sign up for eLearnsecurity PTS course, its an introductory course so does not go that much into depth but I am really enjoying and the content is really high quality, its around $400 which isnt cheap in my expensive but is not as bad as other certification courses. I plan on being more productive and transparent during my go around this time, I may do some videos when I start the course again but for now I will just be updating my github.io blog. 

A list of the resources I have been using as I prepare for the exam

Update: changed wording so that it didnt seem like I already have the certification. My exam is scheduled for the end of December. I also have some more resources that I have found helpful since the last update. I will be adding those sometime this week

# The Basics - Start Here
these are the resources I used to get more comfortable with linux, scripting, TCP/IP, etc. I recommend starting with these especially if you dont have much/any experience

# Metasploit 
although it has been said that Metasploit use is limited during the exam, Offensive Security recommends getting more familiar with Metasploit. I have been going through the metasploit unleashed course its really good info, i would be suprised if I dont have to come back to this repeatedly
